Despacito (Remix),Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee,23.6M,https://genius.com/Luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-despacito-remix-lyrics,"[Letra de ""Despacito (Remix)"" ft. Justin Bieber]

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah

Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]

¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan

Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más

Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)

Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido


[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje


[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber, Daddy Yankee]

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye![Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido


[Puente: Luis Fonsi]

Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico

I just wanna hear you screaming, ""¡Ay, bendito!""
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Báilalo![Outro: Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi & Justin Bieber]

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (DY)
Despacito"
Rap God,Eminem,19M,https://genius.com/Eminem-rap-god-lyrics,"[Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""

""But I'm only going to get this one chance""
(Six minutes—, six minutes—)

""Something's wrong, I can feel it""
(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)

""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""

""You are just what the doc ordered""


[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot


[Verse 1]

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket

My pen'll go off when I half-cock it

Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a livin' and a killin' off it

Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack

I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop

You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'

Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that

I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact

How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack

Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad

It's actually disastrously bad for the wack

While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?

Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got


[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance

Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

Hit the Earth like an asteroid

Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)

MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you,
they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames

Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

On the wall of shame

You fags think it's all a game,
'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and,
tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)

You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy

""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back

And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?

I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy

I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit

Get outta my face, lookin' boy!

Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR

Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God

Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard


[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent

Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken

I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'

I'm out my Ramen Noodle

We have nothin' in common, poodle

I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil

It's me, my honesty's brutal

But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while

So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes

To maybe try to help get some people through tough times

But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime

I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine

You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was,
but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal

You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though

And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for

You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows

You write normal? Fuck being normal!

And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya,
like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel

So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""

Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)

Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma,
you assumin' I'm a human

What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman

Innovative and I'm made of rubber
so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and

I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating

Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting

For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating

'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated

I make elevating music, you make elevator music

""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it

""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it

With rock,
shock rap with Doc

Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it

""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""

Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you

How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!

Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me

Full of myself, but still hungry

I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to

And I'm a million leagues above you

Ill when I speak in tongues,
but it's still tongue-in-cheek,
fuck you

I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat

Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""

But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate

But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred

I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!

But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?

Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake
if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and

Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?"

Whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house (Hol' up)

I said certified freak, seven days a week
Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)


[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy


[Verse 1: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge

Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside

Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes

This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm a surprise
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage

Make it cream, make me scream

Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)

Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)

I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)

Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)

Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker

Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra

With a hook in it, hope it lean over

He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit

He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic

I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat

My head game is fire, punani Dasani

It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me
(Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo[Verse 4: Megan Thee Stallion]
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes

Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'

Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in

Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)

In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya

If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder

Big D stand for big demeanor

I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya

If it don't hang, then he can't bang

You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain

If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah


[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some wet-ass pussy

Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like


[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)

You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour

And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)


[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this

Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts

Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub

Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?

I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk

Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk

If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk

If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know


[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil’, hol’ up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Hol’ up, bitch)

Who that nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)

Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right

I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks

Still I take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks

Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy

This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy

Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

Lose Yourself,Eminem,10.6M,https://genius.com/Eminem-lose-yourself-lyrics,"[Intro]

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

Yo

[Verse 1]

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti

He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow

Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity

Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter

He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant

He knows when he goes back to this mobile home,
that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping

This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order

A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder

Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over

These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads

God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada,
and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner

But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah


[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed

I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher

Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper

All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-

Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family

'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed,
plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna

Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot

Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got

To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot

So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got


[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man"

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""

I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos

I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential

Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side

I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

Bohemian Rhapsody,Queen,10.1M,https://genius.com/Queen-bohemian-rhapsody-lyrics,"[Intro]

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see

I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy

Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters


[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come

Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go

Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)

I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man

Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me

(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?

Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!


[Verse 4]

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?

Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here[Outro]

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose

Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes

This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)

Was off the Remy, had a Papoose

Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves

Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew

I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice

Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits

And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose[Refrain: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]

To win the retreat, we all in too deep

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit

Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue

All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group

Hit my eses, I need the bootch

'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""

In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh

She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""

We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool

Now I got her open, it's just the Goose

Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'

I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, na-na

Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na-na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice

Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights

You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na-na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you (Ah)

We be all night
And everything all right

No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights

Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend

Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac,
gangster wife

Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up

Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin'
On the mic to my boy toys

Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard

Grainin' on that wood, grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good (Hahaha)[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]

Talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all the shit that I heard

Hope you can handle this curve, uh

Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol

Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off, on sight
Catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite

I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae,"" I'm nice

For y'all to reach these heights

Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in[Chorus: Beyoncé, Beyoncé & JAY-Z]

I've been on the low, I been taking my time

I feel like I'm out of my mind

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why


[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]

It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover

It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things

And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did


[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die


[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore"

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes

Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look

I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee

I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?

I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE

I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe

My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent

And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)

I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me

Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap

And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill

Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill[Chorus]

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp

Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block

And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip

I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role

I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith

I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate

I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate

Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes

Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott[Chorus]

Then ju— okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on

Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on

All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion

If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it

Vacayed in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali (Mm)

She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick

A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Mm)

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles

Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble

Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)

Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch

Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?

Rather be tied up with calls and not strings

Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""

Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches

Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""

Never mind, I got the juice

Nothing but net when we shoot

Look at my neck, look at my jet

Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah[Chorus]

We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
At 56 a gram, 5 a hundred grams though

Hit the strip club, we be lettin' bands go

I just might snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything

Remind me where I can't go

Count up hella them bands though
Boy how far can your bands go?

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—

Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?

Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?

Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga


[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane

This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain

It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans

It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself

Uh, Warriors and Conans,
hope euphoria can slow dance
With society,
the driver seat, the first one to get killed

Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine

Pakistan on every porch is fine,
we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?

Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?

Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers

Suck a dick or die or sucker punch

A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's,
""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch

Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce

Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve

Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs

Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys

When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct

Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect

They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat

You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

m.A.A.d. city[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?

Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?

Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?

It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do


[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad

Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
(Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in

Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
(Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin',
the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons
but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""[Interlude: MC Eiht]

G-yeah, cocaine, weed

Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc

Sherm sticks,
butt-nakeds

Dip, make a nigga flip

Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit

One time's crooked and shit

Block a nigga in

Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton


[Verse 2: MC Eiht]

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool

Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules

But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang

Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me

A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah

Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can

Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave

Mount up, regulators in the whip

Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah

Trip, we in the hood still

So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah

Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball
and some Now and Laters to eat?

If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?

Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor

Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage

Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn,
they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive

Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye

Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA

Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck

Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next

Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack

Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack

Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap

Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, Dad isn't mad

But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man-bun?

The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked

Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me

I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze

Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""

So before you die let's see who can out-petty who

Wit' your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh

But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew

Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food

But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you (Woo!)

Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow

Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)

Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)

Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?

'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…

""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof

Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho

Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true

I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage

Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddie, go play

Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay

Got the Diddy okay, so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat

You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay

Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow

Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain

Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)

My biggest flops are your greatest hits

The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss

Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)

Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait

In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name

Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it

Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven, you'd look up to me
And for the record
, you would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel

Give your life to be as solidified

This motherfuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?

Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper

How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow

Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!

You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey

Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better

That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick

Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked

Who else want it? Kells, attempt fails! Budden, L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle

Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah

I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)

I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)

I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)

All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)

Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)

Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)

Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage

Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn

Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)[Chorus: Post Malone]

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)

Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool

And they ain't got on no bra (Bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, ""¡No más!"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

They like, ""Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?"" (21)

I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)

Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', ""Where the coke at?"" (21, 21)

Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard

I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard

Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (Ayy)[Chorus: Post Malone & 21 Savage]

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

Runnin' out of pages in your passport

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else

Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no

Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love

Girl that you fucked with killed herself

That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself

Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic

All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'

Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions

Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot

Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up

Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]

Same reason I wrestle with mania

Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut

Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)

In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate

Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

I look like a villain outta those blockbusters

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet[Verse 2: Eminem]

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls

Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?

Risperdal, voices whisper

My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher

I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological

Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka

I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)

How can I have all these fans and perspire?

Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire

And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire

These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers

And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw

'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)

Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair

Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious

It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink

Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat

Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people

Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle

I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto

Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em

I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade

I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill

I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla

You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be

Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me

I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

We're gonna skate to one song, one song only

Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me


[Verse 1: JAY-Z]

So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?

(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy

(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair

Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6

(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks

(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too

You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too

(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days

Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye

Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK[Chorus: JAY-Z & Kanye West]
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray


[Verse 2: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
She said, ""Ye, can we get married at the mall?""
I said, ""Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball""
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all

(Ball so hard)
That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?

(B-ball so hard)
What she order, fish fillet?

(B-ball so hard)
Your whip so cold, this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again

Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she don't wanna dance

Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'

Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley

What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer?
What's that jacket, Margiela?

Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness

Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh


[Interlude]
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me


[Outro: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Both]
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone

You know how many hot bitches I own?

Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone

The stars is in the building

They hands is to the ceiling

I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone

Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you


[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you

I hate you, I love you

I hate that I want you

You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her


[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat

Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember

Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you

If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit

I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit

I type a text, but then I never mind that shit

I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit

Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know

If you wanted me, you would just say so

And if I were you, I would never let me go[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm

Wedding bells were just alarms

Caution tape around my heart

You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed

Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance

I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings

When love and trust are gone

I guess this is moving on

Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you

You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her


[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?


[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you

You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"

Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)


[Verse 1]
Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles

Granddaddy had the golden flask
, backstroke every day in Chicago

Some people like the way it feel
, some people wanna kill their sorrow

Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem

I was in a dark room, loud tunes
, lookin' to make a vow soon

That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat

Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me


[Chorus]

Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?

I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

All the girls wanna play Baywatch

I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it[Post-Chorus]

Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)

[Verse 2]

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick

If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes

I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived

This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin'
, I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me


[Chorus]

Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?

I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it[Post-Chorus]

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Where is she takin' me?

Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in...)

[Verse 3]

All I—all I—all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure

And I got hunger pain that grow insane
, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf

As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me

I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up

In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

I've created a monster

'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver

Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker

Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital

By the doctor when I'm not cooperating

When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)

You waited this long, now stop debating

'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating

I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be

Or let me be me, so let me see

They tried to shut me down on MTV

But it feels so empty without me

So come on and dip, bum on your lips

Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits

And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy

I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie!)[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me

So everybody, just follow me

'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis

They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless

'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""

A visionary, vision is scary

Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves

A rebel
, so just let me revel and bask

In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe

For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?

Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na

Fix your bent antenna, tune it in
, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling

Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free

A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?[Chorus: Eminem]

You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me

You don't know me, you're too old, let go

It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now, let's go, just give me the signal

I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults

I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But, sometimes, the shit just seems

Everybody only wants to discuss me

So this must mean I'm disgusting

But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy

I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley

To do Black music so selfishly

And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)

There's a concept that works

Twenty million other white rappers emerge

But no matter how many fish in the sea

It'd be so empty without me[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me

And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss

And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals

Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope

But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?


[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too

You think I give a damn about a Grammy?

Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""

Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?

So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?

Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)

I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me

And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?


[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can

Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens

And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working

And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'

He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)

Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up

And put one of those fingers on each hand up?

And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA

Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA

I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA

I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon

I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed

This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA

I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA

I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA

I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve

Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard

I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA

Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge

See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front

Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son

I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade

When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate

And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert

And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard

And pessimists never struck my nerve

And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
Five, four, three, two, one
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages


[Verse 2]

Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you

My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination

This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow

And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window

Baby in the pool, godfather goals

Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana

Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate

I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks

These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way

You ain't shit without a body on your belt

You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate

You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate

Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate

Sex, money, murder—our DNA[Video Outro]"

Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'

Gotta provide for my daughter n'em—get the fuck up out my way, bish!

Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bish!

Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass

From the gardens where the grass ain't cut

Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is

In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees

First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you

Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled

Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill

Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga


[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know


[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved


[Verse 2]
No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one

Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God
, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""

Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it

She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily

Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love

That Jada and that Will love

That leave a toothbrush at your crib love

And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love

Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes

Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap

You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?

Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
""I'ma need my shirt back"" (Nigga, you know how it go)[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet

My only regret was too young for Nia Long

Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along

My only regret was too young for Sade Adu

My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home

Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

How does a
bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman,
dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean
by providence, impoverished, in squalor

Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?


[JOHN LAURENS]
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father

Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter

By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter


[THOMAS JEFFERSON]

And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up

Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of

The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter


[JAMES MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain


[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and

The world's gonna know your name. What's your name, man?”[ALEXANDER HAMILTON]

Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton

And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...


[ELIZA HAMILTON]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden

Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick


[FULL COMPANY EXCEPT HAMILTON (whispering)]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick


[GEORGE WASHINGTON & COMPANY, BOTH]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide

Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying

“Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.”

He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf


[BURR & COMPANY, BOTH]
There would have been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for
his late mother's landlord

Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford

Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on

Plannin' for the future
see him now as he stands on (ooh)
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man[COMPANY & HAMILTON, WOMEN, MEN]
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)

We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Just you wait
Another immigrant
Comin' up from the bottom

Just you wait
His enemies destroyed his rep

Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds

He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done

He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""

Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch

I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got

I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""

Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward

I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour

Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial

Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother

You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap

Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders

It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again

But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood

Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again—oops, accident

It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us

[Intro: Dido]

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


[Chorus: Dido]

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


[Verse 1: Eminem]

Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em

But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him

I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam

I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man

I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat

Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan[Chorus: Dido]

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


[Verse 2: Eminem]

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans

If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""

That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither

He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed

I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me

See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7

But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too[Chorus: Dido]

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans

This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it

I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?

You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?

That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'

Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!

You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me

See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too

Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now

Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?![Chorus: Dido]

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you

But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some

And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other

I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better

I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid

And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you
Damn..."

I was wondering if, after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well

Where nothing ever happened?[Pre-Chorus]

Are running out of time

Mockingbird,Eminem,5.2M,https://genius.com/Eminem-mockingbird-lyrics,"[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now

But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip

What you cryin' about?
You got me


[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had

I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers

No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it

We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls

Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers

But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright

Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright


[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom

And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block

And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara

And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV

And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit

And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here

Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?

Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright

Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright


[Outro]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine

I'ma break that birdie's neck

I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat
, don't fuck with Dad!

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

I can feel your energy from two planets away
, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe


[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist

I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous
, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is

How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?

Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart

Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
, I can admit that it did look like yours

Why you resent every makin' of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge


[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous
, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'

To you, that's a quick check
, with all disrespect, let me say this[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise, Kendrick Lamar]

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe


[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya
, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior

This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to

Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box

I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock


[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard the coast
Like this in a long time

And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th

Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Hide 'til it's bright out

Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble

As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles

Kanye West samples, here's one for example


[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it

Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster

I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert

Profit, profit, nigga, I got it

Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster

I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands


[Verse 2: Kanye West]

Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh

And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch

Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this

Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists

And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit

I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain

Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane

Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent

Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""

Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style

Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out

'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus

Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus

Head of the class and she just won a swallowship

I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past

My presence is a present, kiss my ass[Chorus: Kanye West & Jay Z]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it

Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster

I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert

[Verse 3: Jay Z]

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster

Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense

Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is

None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams

Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children

Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it

All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers

All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air

All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins

I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up[Chorus: Kanye West]

Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do

Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe

Young Money is the roster and a monster crew

And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't

So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it

Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent

Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it

Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded

But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake

And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day

Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday

Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash

I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster[Outro: Justin Vernon & Charlie Wilson]

I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide

And I, I wouldn't last these shows

So I, I am headed home (Headed home)

I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)

Have you got colour in your cheeks?

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?

Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?

I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?

'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat

Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee


[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?

For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

You've had a few?
'Cause I always do

Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new

Crawlin' back to you[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?

Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts

Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you

But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

Five mil' on YouTube in six months, never done before
Passed all the competition, man, PewDiePie is next

Man, I'm poppin' all these checks, got the brand new Rolex

And it match the Lambo too, and I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention
Talking shit on Twitter, too, but you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52, and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth

And I just dropped some new merch, and it's selling like a god church

Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun

Number one and number four, that's why these fans all at our door
It's lonely at the top, so we all going
We left Ohio, now the trio's all rollin'

Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97

Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience

Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options

You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way

I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB

I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap

I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs

This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch

You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more

Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas

And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up

I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one[Chorus]

Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""

I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'

I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?

Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me

Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?

Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy

I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

Only got twenty dollars in my pocket

This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""

Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop

Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty

The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold-ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine

Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green

Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments

Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in

Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain, bitch

I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)

Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers

Dookie-brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard

I bought a skeet blanket
, then I bought a knee board

Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow

John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no

I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""[Chorus: Wanz]

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket

This is fucking awesome

What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?

What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?

I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up

Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt
'cause right now,
I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins

I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Men's)

Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and rock that, motherfucker

The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker

I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition

Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dope

And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't

Peep game, come take a look through my telescope

Tryna get girls from a brand? Man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't

Goodwill

Poppin' tags, yeah[Chorus: Wanz]

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome


[Bridge: Wanz]
I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (Now come on, man)
I'm in this big-ass coat (Big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (Let's go, come on)

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket

I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)

I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends

Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways

Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy


[Verse 1: Eminem]

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey

Wanted to receive attention for my music

Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me

For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways

Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see,
but it was confusing

'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!

But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet

It was like winnin' a used mink

Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink

I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep

Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith

But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it

Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from

Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders

I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict

'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head,
keep knockin'

Give every kid who got played that

Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great

Shawty really blow the pipe (That's true), like a pro (Ah)
Aha (Wha-?)[Pre-Chorus]
Holy shit, I'm really lit (It's lit)
It's lookin' like it's 'bout time (Shee), to fuck it up (Work)
Caroline, listen up, don't wanna hear
About your horoscope or what the future holds

Shut up and, shut up and

[Chorus]
Let's get gory like a Tarantino movie

Don't wanna talk it out, can we fuck it out?
'Cause we gon' be up all night, fuck a decaf

You say I'm a tall thug, guess I'm a G-raffe

If you want safe sex, baby, use the knee pads

Freaky with the sticky-icky,
baby, give me kitty, kitty

Mmm, killa, westside nigga (Ayy, ayy, damn)

Boy, you like 98 degrees and I'm 300
Nigga, keep your feet runnin' (Hot, hot)
I Chief-Keef-Keef when I eat these beats,
bet a boy get scurred (Get scurred)

Don't run up in my lane, I don't want you in my lane
You a lame, get swerved

[Post-Chorus]

'Cause great scenes might be great
But I love your bloopers

And perfect's for the urgent
Baby, I want forever

I want you to be my—[Outro]

[Intro: Big Sean]
Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga


[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches

I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'

‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit

‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit

They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather

G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never

Swear flow special like an infant's first steps

I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress

So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside

No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that ""Juicy"" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'

Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair

They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor

You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone

I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody

I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot

The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic

And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'

And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar

Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street

I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond

Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!

Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon

So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit

So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit

So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch

One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork

I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both

The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes

Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!

Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt

This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)

I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons

Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key

Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley

I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!

I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis

You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas

Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way

And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas

Eminem, André 3000;
the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved

And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit

White T’s and Nike Cortez,
this red Corvette's anonymous

I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas

What is competition?
I'm tryna raise the bar high

Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said

That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread

West Coast[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]

You could check my name on the books

I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook

The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof

The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers

We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders

And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest

The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over

Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova

I’m spittin' this shit for closure

And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova

To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra

I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock

That’s why I came with the rock

Then signed my name on the Roc

Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot

‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got

The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart

And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark

You go from blind sight to hindsight

Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight

It take time to get your mind right

Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries

In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history

You can’t say shit to me,
الحمد لله

It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far"

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]

I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)


[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)

I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)

Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah

King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)


[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'

Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker

I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help

This shit is elementary,
I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left

Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest

And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too

Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!

Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him

Life ain't shit but a fat vagina

Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""

Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*

By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*

All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it

Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (Yeah)
Pass the plate (Yeah), where my drink (Hol' up)?
This my day (Yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall

Turn my back on you, all of you finished (Bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (Yuh)
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (Yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)

Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)

Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)

They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side

Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope

You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo! Woo!)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)[Refrain: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it

I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules

Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose

I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full

I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners

You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter

They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)

And actually comin' from humble beginnings

I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""

But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility

Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?

Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back

'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap

I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that

But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'

Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits

I'm asleep at the wheel again
, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again

Levels to this shit, I got an elevator

You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record

Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)

But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy

It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw

That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys[Chorus: Eminem & Joyner Lucas]
So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out and shoot

That David played and it pleased the Lord

The minor fall, the major lift

The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof

You saw her bathing on the roof

Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya

She tied you to a kitchen chair

She broke your throne
and she cut your hair

And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah


[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?

There's a blaze of light in every word

It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya

I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


[Additional Lyrics]

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?

And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too

And every breath we drew was Hallelujah


[Additional Lyrics]

Maybe there's a God above

But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah"
Say You Won’t Let Go,James Arthur,4.8M,https://genius.com/James-arthur-say-you-wont-let-go-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough

We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up


[Pre-Chorus]
Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head

And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night[Pre-Chorus]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah

And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow


[Chorus]
I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old[Post-Chorus]

Don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest (Ayy)
Still not understandin' this logic (Ayy)
I'm back and I'm better (And I'm better)
I want you bad as ever

Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level

Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together

Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh

Light up a spliff and get high

Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, ""Just listen""[Chorus]
Don't
Don't


[Verse 2]
Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything

Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane

Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way

Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space

Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

Don't

Young money got a nigga feelin' old

Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly (Yeah)

They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus (Out of focus)

That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit (Woo!)

Otay, pray them niggas go away (Go away)

Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil (Soleil)

She said she twenty-one, I might have to ID that

All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack

I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name

I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game

Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history

I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth

Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)

So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury

Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys

And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber[Chorus: KYLE]

Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it

Say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go


[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh

And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance
, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis

With poetic justice, poetic justice

If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?

I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when

You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen

Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all

I really wanna show you off, fuck that
, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry

They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell

But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright[Verse 2: Drake]

I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations
You've been takin', clearly a lot for me to take in,
it don't make sense

Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' witcha other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane, take you and your momma to the motherland
, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone

When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from

That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice

You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex

Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell

But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo

Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
, I'm talkin'
Poetic justice, poetic justice

If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?

I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' for it, maybe
, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain

I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb

And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm

That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, PS


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Janet Jackson]
Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

I am the champ, I'm Iron Mike in a bout

Attention, I'ma need you to face front
You don't want smoke with me, this is a laced blunt

Rap's Jackie Chan, we ain't pullin' them fake stunts

My crown won't fit on your bum-ass lace fronts (Uh)

You bitches catchin' a fade, shout out my nigga Lil Boosie

All of your friends'll be dead, you can get hit with that Uzi

I call him Ricky, he say he love me like Lucy

Get you a straw nigga, you know this pussy is juicy
This Givenchy is custom made, now you can't get it at Saks though

I don't work in no office, but they copyin' and that's facts though

I ain't tryna be violent, but if Nicki on it, it slaps, ho

Get you lined for that paper like a loose leaf when that strap blow

I'm with a couple bad bitches that'll rip the party
If Quavo the QB, I'm Nick Lombardi

Pull up in the space coupe, I done linked with Marty

I can actually afford to get a pink Bugatti

""Ayo, Nick, didn't you just do a hit with Gotti?""
That too, but my niggas send hits like Gotti

It's a wrap, like the things on the head of a Saudi

Bitch, you my son, go and sit on the potty (Rrrrrr)[Verse 5: Takeoff]
Brand new Chanels (Chanels)
I scuffed 'em runnin' from 12 (12)

Ain't make no commitment with none of you bitches
'Cause money is treatin' me well (Uh-uh)
If Nicki should show me her titty
Right hand on the Bible, I swear I won't tell (Swear)

If I get to play with that kitty
I wonder how many platinums we gon' sell (Albums)

Pop a Perc and catch a feel (I pop one)
Now I cannot feel the wheel (Woah)

My chest bad, give me chills (Ice)

And the left hand on Richard Mille (Ice)
Not the watch, but the price on the ice
If you don't know what that is (Huh)

Motorsport, motorville
Abort the mission, that's a kill (Pew, pew, brrr)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Motorsport, yeah, put that thing in sport (Skrrt, skrrt)

Shawty bad (Bad), pop her like a cork (Pop it)

You a dork, never been a sport (Dork, yeah)
Pull up, woo, woo, jumpin' out the court (Jump)

Cotton candy (Drink), my cup tastes like the fair (Cotton)

Straight up there (Where?), we didn't take the stairs (Where?)
Faced my fears (My fears), gave my mama tears (Mama)
Shiftin' gears (Shift), on the Nawf, get serious (Serious)

Girl, yeah, yeah, I wish my grandma could see me (Grandma)
Take away pain, ain't easy (Pain)
That's why I fire up a bleezy (Fire)

You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail

I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail

He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet

This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah

I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats

Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro

Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost

I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt

Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike

Love Yourself,Justin Bieber,4.6M,https://genius.com/Justin-bieber-love-yourself-lyrics,"[Produced by Benny Blanco]


[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't


[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that


[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from


[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself[Bridge]

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?


[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],Taylor Swift,4.5M,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-all-too-well-10-minute-version-taylors-version-from-the-vault-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place

And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me

Wind in my hair, I was there

I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed

And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town

And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now

He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath

Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest

I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell

Every time you double-cross my mind

You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you

Not weepin' in a party bathroom

Some actress askin' me what happened, you

That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes

Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show

But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come

And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me

You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes

""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""

From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones

I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?

Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well


[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well

Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there

It was rare, you remember it"

Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

Take Me to Church,Hozier,4.5M,https://genius.com/Hozier-take-me-to-church-lyrics,"[Verse 1]

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval

I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece

Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well


[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen


[Chorus]
Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Offer me that deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight

To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny

Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?

We've a lot of starvin' faithful

That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife

Offer me my deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife

Offer me my deathless death

Oh, good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

They ordered champagne but still look thirsty

Rock Forever 21, but just turned thirty

I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation

Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation

Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation

I turnt the nightclub out of the basement

I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans

Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?

Hello, welcome home

[Outro: Khalid, Billie Eilish, Khalid & Billie Eilish]
Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah
Hello, welcome home"
